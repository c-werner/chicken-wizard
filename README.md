# Chicken Wizard

This is a basic project I created to learn Godot. You're a wizard who's running around turning people into chickens.

Many of the sprites came from https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset (others were created or recolored by me)

## Where to Play

You can play a [wasm version](https://c-werner.github.io/chicken-wizard/)

Or clone to repo and build it yourself using https://godotengine.org/

## Controls
WASD or arrow keys to move
Mouse and left click to shoot


## To Do

- Further clean up project structure
- Fix tileset layering z-order issues
- Add actual enemies
- Camera
- Level structure
- Use a font that scales
- Sound
- Figure out how to handle https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24311
