# Chicken Wizard

This is a basic project I created to learn Godot

Many of the sprites came from https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset (others were created or recolored by me)

## To Do

- Clean up project structure
- Fix tileset layering z-order issues
- Add actual enemies
- Camera
- Level structure
- Use a font that scales
- Sound
